# Bitcoin-Address-Features
The dataset consists of 100000 addresses: 50000 addresses were reported by users while the remaining were not found in reported addresses on BitcoinAbuse.com (until  28-02-2023). Every row corresponds to features of one address. 

The address column has been omitted, only their features are provided. Some reported addresses (with a 1 in the Reported column) have no transaction resulting in similar features. A version in which similar features have been removed is included.
